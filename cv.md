## About me:

I want to try myself in a new professional field and study layout and front-end development. I started to get acquainted with this only from November 2022. I really like the IT community and the way they build it, and I also like the whole idea of creating websites and turning my work into something useful for other people.

My goal is to become a web developer, and my strengths are excellent communication skills, persistence, curiosity and a desire to learn new things.

I’m interested in Web Development because this trade provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
